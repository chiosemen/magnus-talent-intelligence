# Technical Readiness Report

## Scores
- **Architecture Maturity:** 62 / 100  
  Core Next.js + BullMQ + Supabase pattern is coherent, but the queue lacks production safeguards (no backoff/removeOnFail across stages) and the worker assumes happy paths, limiting resilience.
- **Security Readiness:** 48 / 100  
  Sample configs still ship with real-looking `sk-…` keys, dotenv loading is path-relative, and both Python & Node code swallow Supabase/OpenAI errors without structured logging—risking silent data loss and secret leakage.
- **Deployment Automation:** 45 / 100  
  Missing Dockerfiles, no lockfile, dev-mode commands in Compose, and a CI workflow that skips Render deploys leave releases highly manual; cache efficiency and image size are unaddressed.

## Risk Summary

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Odds (90d) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docker builds fail (absent Dockerfiles / dev-mode compose) | Critical | 70% | Straightforward once Dockerfiles + `.dockerignore` from patch plan are applied; requires lockfile commit. |
| CLI crashes on OpenAI scorer import | Critical | 60% | Fix queued via generated patch; needs engineering bandwidth to land/tests. |
| Render worker missing SMTP env vars | Critical | 55% | Requires coordinated secret updates in Render; ops process currently undefined. |
| Secrets leakage via committed `.env` samples | Major | 50% | Needs repo hygiene policy + rotation; depends on team adopting new secret management flow. |
| Queue jobs orphaned on failure | Major | 40% | Requires revisiting job configs & Supabase error handling; trickier due to cascading async logic. |
| CI lacks Render deploy + package caching | Major | 35% | Added action snippet, but adoption relies on securing Render API key and lockfile discipline. |
| CLI file reads assume seeded resume/JD | Minor | 60% | Low-effort guard already drafted; depends on product decision around data sourcing. |

## Investor Takeaways

- Product functionality is proven, but infrastructure hardening remains. Several redline deployment items (Docker, CI, queue reliability) must be resolved before scaling spend.
- Security posture is not yet audit-ready; immediate work is needed on secret management, error observability, and API guardrails.
- With the scripted fixes provided, management can close the top three blockers in the next sprint; deeper resiliency upgrades should follow before enterprise pilots.
